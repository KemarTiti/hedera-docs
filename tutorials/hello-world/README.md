# Hello World

❓ So you want to develop on [Hedera](https://hedera.com/).

🤷 Not sure where to start?

🕙 Why not start with something you could complete in 10 minutes?

🏁 Let's go! 🎉🎉🎉

## Hello World Sequences

There are multiple Hello World sequences for you to follow along.

To start, you **must** do the first sequence, as you will need a **funded account** to do any other tasks on Hedera. Subsequently, you can do the remaining sequences in any order.

* [Create and fund an account](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-docs/blob/staging/tutorials/hello-world/create-fund-account/README.md)
* [HFS: Files](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-docs/blob/staging/tutorials/hello-world/hfs-files/README.md)
* [HSCS: Smart contract](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-docs/blob/staging/tutorials/hello-world/hscs-smart-contract/README.md)
